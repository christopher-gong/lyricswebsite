				</div>
				<div class = "aboutbody">
					Kehlani Ashley Parrish (born April 24, 1995), recording mononymously as Kehlani,is an American singer, songwriter and dancer, signed to Atlantic Records. Kehlani is originally from Oakland, California, where she achieved initial fame as a member of the teen group Poplyfe.

In 2014, she released her first commercial mixtape, Cloud 19. The mixtape was listed as one of the Complex's "50 Best Albums of 2014." In 2015, Kehlani released her second commercial mixtape, You Should Be Here. The mixtape debuted at number 5 on the national R&B/Hip-Hop chart, preceded from her sold-out North American promotional tour. In 2016, she was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album for You Should Be Here. Kehlani released her first major-label debut album, SweetSexySavage on January 27, 2017.

					 <div id = songtitle> ANTISUMMERLUV </div> 
					It didn’t take long for the music world to catch on to Kehlani’s talent, but long before becoming a Grammy-nominated artist, the Oakland singer was a fresh-faced, burgeoning singer looking for her big break. Her break came after uploading her first single “ANTISUMMERLUV” to Soundcloud, a downtempo, jazz-tinged earworm – courtesy of Derek “D.O.A” Allen – that provided the perfect melody for Lani to feather her honey warble over.
					<div id = songtitle> Distraction </div> 
					As 2016 winded down, Kehlani dropped off the infectious “Distraction,” a breezy, '90s-nodding track with vocal runs reminiscent of R&B singer Brandy, incessant drum strikes, and a driving bass line. Kehlani sings about wanting the perks of a relationship without the commitment because her “life can get crazy” and she doesn’t want any distractions.

					After churning out singles for years, 2016 was the year things started to look up for Kehlani. She nabbed a Grammy nomination for her 2015 mixtape You Should Be Here and earned her first-ever Billboard Hot 100 hit with “Gangsta,” her contribution to the 2016 film Suicide Squad’s soundtrack.
